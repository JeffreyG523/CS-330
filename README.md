# CS-330
For this project, we developed a simple OpenGL application to handle object collisions. Much of the existing code was reused, but we integrated knowledge from other modules to implement the necessary changes. Initially, I adjusted one of the bricks to be user-controllable, meeting the assignment's requirements. The brick could be moved left and right using the 'A' and 'D' keys, mimicking classic arcade games.
Next, I added a feature allowing the object to shoot projectiles by pressing the "Enter" key, launching circles upward from the player's object. Additionally, I implemented interactions between the sceneâ€™s circles and bricks. I modified the bricks to include a damage threshold, changing color from white to yellow to red as they approach breaking.
The circles required significant modifications to the existing code. I duplicated the collision testing function to reference other circle objects and added logic for each circle to check for collisions with others before updating their positions. Through trial and error, I created a loop to iterate through all circles except the reference one. When two circles collide, if one has a higher red color value than the other, the redder circle will "eat" the less red one and enlarge, causing it to slow down due to the extra mass.
The final objective was to make the physics more realistic. Although not perfect, objects now have movement directions that make sense. For instance, objects moving upward will change to a downward movement rather than receiving random directions.
